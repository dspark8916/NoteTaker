# NoteTaker

## Description

It's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows you to have written information available when needed. In order to help people with this our task was to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Putting all this together will make the users life a lot easier!!

## User Story

```
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
